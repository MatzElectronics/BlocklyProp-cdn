<h2>RC time</h2>

<p><img src="help-images/rc_time_block.png" style="height:26px; width:232px"></p>

<p>The <strong>RC time (formerly RC charge/discharge)</strong> block sets the specified Propeller I/O pin to an input and reports how long it takes for an RC (resistor/capacitor) circuit to either charge or discharge across the pin's logic threshold. The value provided by the block is in microsecond units.&nbsp; This block must be used in conjunction with other blocks to charge (or discharge) the circuit before taking the measurement.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the the Propeller I/O pin connected to the target circuit in the RC dropdown. I/O pin options will vary by board type.</li>
	<li>Choose which process time to measure (charge or discharge) from the RC dropdown. Or, click Other and insert a block that resolves to an I/O pin value.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="notebox">The RC time block is useful for circuits with a variable resistor or other means to affect current flow, including potentiometers, phototransistors, thermistors, and some pressure sensors. See <a href="http://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/language/blocklyprop/circuit-practice-blocklyprop/read-potentiometer-rc-time">Read a Potentiometer with RC Time</a> for an example of this block in action.</span></p>
