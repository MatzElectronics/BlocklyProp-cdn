<p>The <strong>play tone&nbsp;</strong>block plays one or two tones for a specified period. Both the duration and frequency are set by the user. Either frequency can be left at the default 0 Hz, for silence, or set up to 10,000 Hz. The duration can be set between zero and 8,000 ms. For values outside of the valid 0 to 10,000 Hz and 1 to 8,000 ms ranges, the block will use the closest value that is within range. The Scribbler robot will not run the next block command until the note finishes playing.</p>
