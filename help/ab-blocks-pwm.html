<h2>PWM set</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="help-images/pwm-set-pin-block.png" style="height:42px; width:396px"></p>

<p><img alt="" src="help-images/BlocklyIcons-Brain.png" style="height:17px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; width:19px">This block lauches a processor automatically. Each subsequent instance of this block changes the PWM behavior as configured, but does not launch an additional processor.</p>

<p>The <strong>PWM set </strong>block begins outputting a pulse-width modulated signal on the pin specified in the dropdown box with a duty cycle set by the value block is. For example, if the value block is set to 75, the PWM signal will be on 75% of the time and off 25% of the time. There are two PWM channels available on the Propeller microcontroller, so up to two PWM set blocks (one set to channel A and the other set to channel B) operating at one time. Setting the duty cycle to 0 (zero) turns the PWM signal off.</p>

<p><span class="notebox">Note that the<strong> PWM Initialize</strong> block has been deprecated, and its functionality was added to the<strong> PWM set </strong>block</span></p>

<h2>PWM stop</h2>

<p>The <strong>PWM stop </strong>block stops the PWM process and frees up the resources it was using on the Propeller microcontroller.</p>
