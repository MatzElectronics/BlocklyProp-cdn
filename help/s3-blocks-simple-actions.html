<p>The <strong>drive</strong> block runs the Scribbler robot motors at a direction and speed determined by the user. The Scribbler robot will continue running the motors while running block commands, until the stop driving command is used.</p>

<h2>rotate</h2>

<p><img src="/sites/default/files/content/S3/image15.png"></p>

<p>The <strong>rotate block</strong> rotates the Scribbler robot in place, in either direction, to a angle and at a top speed determined by the user. The angle, from 1 to 359 degrees, can be typed in or selected from a drop-down angle selector. The Scribbler robot will not run the next block command until the Scribbler robot stops moving.</p>

<h2>stop driving</h2>

<p>The <strong>stop</strong> <strong>driving</strong> block immediately disables the Scribbler robot motors.</p>
